In addition to internal conversion, intersystem crossing, etc, a number of molecular interaction processes such as excited state reactions, complex formation, molecular rearrangements, energy transfer, etc. affect the fluorescence emission of a fluorophore.  Several such intermolecular processes compete with the intrinsic de-excitation of the excited fluorophore. Upon excitation, the fluorophore molecules have been observed to participate in reactions that do not occur in the ground state. Excited fluorophores have been observed to make homo- or hetero-dimeric complexes with the ground-state molecules. The excited complexes have emission spectrum  very different from that of monomeric fluorophores. These emission properties have been exploited for many applications in chemistry, biology, and many other fields.

Depending on the nature and concentration of the fluorophore (M) and the foreign molecules (Q), viscosity of the solvent, etc., the bimolecular interactions with the excited state fluorophore may involve encounter complex (M<sup>*</sup> . . . Q), as seen in dynamic quenching, excimer (MM)<sup>*</sup> or exciplex (MQ<sup>*</sup>) formation. 
</p>
<p>
\begin{equation}
1M + hv  \rightleftharpoons 1M^*
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
1M^* + M  \rightleftharpoons 1(MM)^*
(Excimer)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
1M^* + Q  \rightleftharpoons 1(MQ)^*
(Exciplex)
\end{equation}

</p>

<p>
When collisions between an excited fluorophore molecule and an unexcited identical fluorophore molecule lead to the formation of excited dimeric complexes, such excited dimeric complexes are called the excimers. The word "excimer" is . The word "excimer" is a combined contraction form derived from "<b>exci</b>ted di<b>mer</b>". Excimer formations have been observed with many aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene, pyrene, etc. The "exciplex" is a combined contraction word derived from "<b>exci</b>ted com<b>plex</b>".  The exciplex is formed via collisions between an excited fluorophore molecule and an unexcited unlike molecule. One of the molecules (either fluorophore or the foreign molecule) acts as an electron donor and the other molecule acts as the electron acceptor. For example, exciplex formation has been observed between the electron donor molecule, N,N-diethylamine and excited anthracene molecule. 
</p>
<p>Excimer and exciplex have binding energies greater than the average kinetic energy and represent new chemical species with more or less well-defined geometrical structures. Excimers and exciplexes can lose their excitation energy through fluorescence or decaying processes. These processes result in quenching of the excited state and are therefore known as quenching processes. The formation of excimer and exciplex requires bimolecular interactions and therefore occurs at relatively high concentrations of the species that ensure large number of collisions among the molecules during the life-time of the excited fluorophore. Since the molecules have paired electrons, excimers only form when one of the dimer components is in the excited state when there is an rearrangement of electron distribution. When the excimer returns to the ground state, its components dissociate. The excimer or exciplex formation is therefore reversible. They break apart after emission and may form again on excitation. Excimers and exciplexes are accompanied with a broad structure-less emission band at higher wavelength than that of the monomeric fluorophore molecule. It has been observed that the exciplex emission band is red-shifted when the solvent polarity increases. Temperature and viscosity have also been observed to play important roles in intermolecular process like exciplex formation.</p>

<strong>Exciplex Formation Experiment</strong>
<ol>
<li>
Prepare a 3 x 10<sup>-4</sup> M  solution of anthracene in the presence of following concentrations of N,N-diethylaniline in spectroscopic grade toluene. (i) 0 M; (ii) 5 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M; (iii) 2.5 x 10<sup>-2</sup> M and (iv) 0.10 M. Here the solutions are shown on the concentration selection bar.
</li><li>
To take a particular concentration solution, first click on the appropriate concentration of N,N-diethylaniline on the concentration selection bar and then on the volumetric flask. For measurement, first start with the pure anthracene solution (i.e., 0 M N,N-diethylaniline on the concentration selection bar) and then proceed from lower to higher concentrations. 
</li><li>
To carry out the emission measurements proceed as follows.
</li><li>
Take an all-side-transparent quartz cuvette of path length 1 cm x 1 cm for the fluorescence measurement.
</li><li>
Click on the 5 mL capacity pipette to collect 3 mL of the experimental solution which will be transferred into the quartz cuvette. In real operation, one has to set the volume to 3 mL in the  pipette and an appropriate tip should be attached prior to dipping it in the solution.
</li><li>
Click on the pipette to draw the solution into it.
</li><li>
Click on the pipette to take it out of the volumetric flask.
</li><li>
Click on the pipette again to transfer the solution into the cuvette.
</li><li>
Turn on the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the power button. In real operation, it takes approx. 30 min for initialization of the instrument.
</li><li>
For placing the sample in the instrument, open the lid of the sample chamber of the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the lid.
</li><li>
To place the cuvette in the sample holder of the instrument, click on the cuvette.
</li><li>
Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on the lid.
</li><li>
Open the instrument set-up screen by clicking on the fluorescence icon on the computer monitor. 
</li><li>
Select the Emission Scan Mode on the screen.
</li><li>
On the screen, enter the Excitation wavelength: 350 nm, Emission Start Wavelength: 360 nm and Emission End wavelength: 570 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit(nm) and Emission Slit(nm) values (here 2.5 nm/2.5 nm) and the scan speed value (here  medium ) also.
</li><li>
To run the wavelength scan for the emission spectrum, click on 'OK' button on the set-up screen. One has to be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest. 
</li><li>
Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to save the data. 
</li><li>
To take the cuvette out of the sample chamber, first click on the sample chamber lid to open it and then on the cuvette. 
</li><li>
Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on the lid.
</li><li>
Click on 'Reset' button to start over the measurements.
</li><li>
Select the next higher diethylaniline concentration solution for the measurement by clicking on the concentration selection bar and carry out the Emission scan. If one uses the same cuvette for all the measurements, prior to filling up of the cuvette with the solution, the cuvette should be rinsed a few times with the same solution to be analyzed.
</li><li>
Repeat the Emission scan measurements for all the solutions.
</li><li>
Collect all data by clicking on the Data tab.
</li><li>
Plot all the spectra together.
</li><li>
Find out the development of exciplex emission band. 
</li><li>
Determine the wavelength shift on formation of exciplex emission band.
</li><li>
Discuss how the maximum emission wavelengths and the intensities of the exciplex emission bands change with increasing concentration of N,N-diethylaniline.
