	  We know that there are many “intrinsic” pathways of de-excitation of an excited flurophore molecule. In addition, processes involving interaction of the excited molecule with another molecule (called quencher) competing with the intrinsic de-excitation can be observed. The intermolecular photophysical processes in the presence of quenchers change the fluorescence characteristics (intensity, fluorescence quantum yield, lifetime) as a result of the competition between the intrinsic de-excitation and these intermolecular processes. This process of decrease or loss of the fluorescence intensity in the presence of quenchers is known as “quenching of fluorescence”. A number of molecular interaction processes such as excited state reactions, ground-state complex formation, molecular rearrangements, energy transfer, etc. can decrease the fluorescence intensity of a fluorophore. Analysis of the quenching phenomenon provides qualitative and quantitative information on the surroundings of a fluorescent molecule. Therefore, the fluorescence quenching phenomenon has been exploited for many applications. For example, fluorescence quenching of tryptophan residues in proteins has been a very useful method to detect conformational changes of proteins in different conditions and protein-ligand interactions.
</p>
<p>Quenching requires an interaction along with appropriate electronic orbital overlapping between a fluorophore and the quencher. Based on the nature of interactions, fluorescence quenching is broadly classified into two types: dynamic (or collisional) quenching and static (or complex formation) quenching. Dynamic quenching requires a collision between the quencher and fluorophore while the latter is in its excited state. On the other hand, the static quenching occurs because of a nonfluorescent ground state complex formation between the fluorophore and quencher. Shifts from the fluorophore absorption spectrum upon addition of the quencher provide evidence of such complex formation. In dynamic quenching, no permanent change in the flurophore occurs. The quencher diffuses to the fluorophore during the life time of excitation state. The fluorophore returns to the ground state without emission of photon after collision with quencher. This is a time-dependent process. Common quenchers include O<sub>2</sub>, I<sup>-</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, pyridinium ion, acrylamide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, nitroxides, BrO4-, etc. Oxygen molecule is a  well  known collisional quencher that quenches almost all the fluorophores. The paramagnetic oxygen molecule causes the fluorophores to undergo intersystem crossing, i.e. crossing from the first singlet excited state S1 to the first triplet state T1. This leads to the decrease in the flouroscence intensity. Spin–orbit coupling favors intersystem crossing. The efficiency of this coupling varies with the fourth power of the atomic number, which explains why fluorescence intensity gets quenched by the presence of a heavy atoms, like bromine, iodine, silver, etc. Aromatic and aliphatic amines act as efficient quenchers for most of the unsubstituted hydrocarbons. The fluorophores accept electrons from the amines forming excited charge-transfer state (exciplex).</p>

<p>
The intrinsic pathways of de-excitation of an excited molecule, M<sup>*</sup>, is the sum kM of the rate constants for these processes is equal to the reciprocal of the excited-state lifetime τ<sub>0</sub>: 
\begin{equation}
	k_M = k_r + k_{ic} + k_{isc} = k_r + k_{nr} = 1/τ_0							
\end{equation}

	
</p>
<p>
where kr is the rate constant for fluorescence emission and knr is the sum of first-order rate constants for nonradiative decay pathways, such as internal conversion, intersystem crossing, etc. When a fluorophore molecule reaches the lowest vibrational level of the excited electronic state, the energy quantum for the return to the ground state may be accepted by a suitable molecule present in the solution. This results in the loss of the fluorescence intensity. This process is called quenching. When there is a bimolecular interaction between the excited molecule and the quencher, it can be described as follows: 
</p>
<p>
\begin{equation}
	M^* + Q → M + Q 									
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
		rate_q = k_q [Q] [M* ]									
\end{equation}

	The product k<sub>q</sub>[Q] is pseudo-first-order, where k<sub>q</sub>, is the second-order rate constant for quenching process and [Q] is the quencher concentration. Therefore, the de‑excitation pathways of the molecule M<sup>*</sup>, in the presence of quencher, Q, is given by


\begin{equation}
		k_{M'} = k_r + k_{nr} + k_q [Q] = 1/τ_0 + k_q [Q]		
\end{equation}

		The fluorescence quantum yield in the absence of quencher (Φ0): 

\begin{equation}
				Φ_0 = k_r / (k_r + k_{nr}) = k_r τ_0 								
\end{equation}

	The quantum yield in the presence of quencher (providing dynamic quenching as the only quenching mechanism) is given by:
	 
\begin{equation}
		Φ = k_r / (k_r + k_{nr} + k_q [Q]) = k_r /(1/τ_0 + k_q [Q])						
\end{equation}

	Dividing eq 5 by eq 6 and rearranging, one obtains  

\begin{equation}
		Φ_0/ Φ = 1 + k_q τ_0 [Q] = 1 + K_{SV} [Q]							
\end{equation}

</p>
<p>where K<sub>SV</sub> (=k<sub>q</sub> τ<sub>0</sub>)  is the Stern-Volmer constant for the collision quenching process, τ<sub>0</sub> and τ are the fluorescence lifetimes in the absence and the presence of Q, and k<sub>q</sub> is the bimolecular rate constant for the quenching process. 
</p>
<p>The measured steady-state fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of emitted photons. Therefore, in general the fluorescence intensity and Φ are proportional to each other. If F<sub>0</sub> and F are the steady-state fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of quencher, respectively, then one write the Stern-Volmer eq as follows:

\begin{equation}
	F_0/F = 1 + K_{SV} [Q] 									
\end{equation}
	</p>
	<p>This equation is used to calculate K<sub>SV</sub> or k<sub>q</sub>. A plot of F<sub>0</sub>/F versus the quencher concentration, [Q], is linear (Stern–Volmer plot) with an intercept of 1 and a slope equal to the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, K<sub>SV</sub>, if only dynamic quenching occurs. When the plot is found to be linear, the Stern-Volmer constant is calculated from the slope of the plot. Then, k<sub>q</sub> can be calculated if the excited-state lifetime in the absence of quencher (τ<sub>0</sub>) is known. The rate constant of quenching, k<sub>q</sub>, is equal to the quencher diffusion constant in the case of 100% efficient quenching, which lies typically in the range of 10<sup>9</sup>–10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. One can easily calculate the diffusion controlled rate constant, k<sub>d</sub>, for the bimolecular process in a solvent by using the relation, k<sub>d</sub> = 8RT/3000η, where R is the gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and η is the viscosity of the solvent. The value of k<sub>q</sub> may exceed the diffusion-controlled range when static quenching also occurs in addition to the dynamic quenching.
	</p>
<p>In dynamic quenching, the fluorophore and quencher collide, inducing a loss of fluorophore energy. Then the fluorescence lifetime of these colliding fluorophore molecules is lower than that of the  fluorophore molecules not participating in the dynamic process in solution. Therefore, the mean fluorescence lifetime measured in the presence of dynamic quenching will be lower than the mean lifetime measured in the absence of the quenching. In terms of life time, one can write the Stern-Volmer eq as follows:

\begin{equation}
τ_0/τ = 1 + k_q τ_0 [Q] 									
\end{equation}
</p>
	<p>Time-resolved experiments in the absence and presence of quencher also allow one to calculate K<sub>SV</sub> and k<sub>q</sub>. One can compare the value k<sub>q</sub> with that of diffusion controlled rate constant, k<sub>d</sub> . One should remember that it is important to include time-resolved measurements in the quenching analysis. In static quenching, molecules are quenched a priori and thus do not contribute photons to the lifetime measurement. </p>

<li>
Prepare a 1.0 M pyridinium chloride solution and a 1.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M anthracene solution in spectroscopy grade ethanol. Since the concentration of anthracene is small, first a stock solution of 2.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> M anthracene in spectroscopy grade ethanol is prepared and then it is diluted to the required concentration with the same solvent.
</li><li>
From the above two solutions, prepare six sets of solutions with the following volume compositions: each set containing 3 mL of 1.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M anthracene solution and 0 µL, 7.5 mL, 37.5 µL, 75 µL, 112.5 µL and 150 µL of 1.0 M pyridinium chloride solutions, respectively.  Here these solutions are given on a scale bar for selection.
</li><li>
Run the Emission Spectral scan of the experimental solutions as follows.
</li><li>
To choose a solution with a given volume composition whose fluorescence has to be measured, click on the pointer below the composition selection bar and drag it to the desired value. On selection, the solution appears in a volumetric flask. In real measurements, one should start with the lowest pyridinium chloride concentration first and proceed to next higher concentration and so on. (Why?) 
</li><li>
	Click on the volumetric flask containing the solution to take it to the instrument table.
</li><li>
	Click on the all-side-transparent quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm ×1 cm) to take it to the instrument table. 
</li><li>
	Click on the 5 mL‑capacity pipette to take 2 mL of 10<sup>-5</sup> M anthracene solution for the  measurement. In real operation, one has to set the volume to 2 mL in the pipette and an appropriate tip should be attached prior to dipping it in the solution.
</li><li>
	Click on the same pipette to draw the solution into the pipette.
</li><li>
	Transfer the solution into the cuvette by clicking on the pipette.
</li><li>
	Turn on the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the power button. In real operation, it takes approx. 30 min for initialization of the instrument.
</li><li>
	Open the the sample chamber of the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the lid.
</li><li>
	Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample holder. 
</li><li>
	Click on the chamber lid to close it.
</li><li>
	To run the Emission spectral scan, open the measurement set-up screen by clicking on the fluorescence measurement icon on the computer monitor.
</li><li>
	 Select the Emission Scan Mode on the screen. 
</li><li>
	 On the screen, enter the Excitation wavelength: 350 nm, Emission Start Wavelength: 355 nm and Emission End wavelength: 475 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit and Emission Slit values (here 2 nm/0.5 nm) and the scan speed value (here “medium”) also.   
</li><li>
	 To run the wavelength scan for the emission spectrum, click on 'OK' button on the set-up screen. One has to be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest. 
</li><li>
	 Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to save the data. 
</li><li>
	 Take  the cuvette out of the sample chamber by clicking first on the sample chamber lid to open it and then on the cuvette.
</li><li>
	 Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on it.
</li><li>
	 Click on 'Reset' button to start over the measurement.
</li><li>
	 Select the next higher pyridinium chloride concentration by clicking on the composition selection bar and carry out the Emission scan as before. In real measurements, if one uses the same cuvette for all the measurements, every time one should rinse the cuvette by taking a small portion of the solution to be analyzed prior to filling up the cuvette with the solution. 
</li><li>
	 Similarly, repeat the Emission spectral scans for the rest of the solutions.
</li><li>
	 Collect all data by clicking on the Data tab.
</li><li>
	 Determine and tabulate the values of F<sub>0</sub> and F's for all pyridinium chloride concentrations.
</li><li>
	 Construct the Stern-Volmer Plot.
</li><li>
	 Determine the quenching (Stern-Volmer) constant, K<sub>SV</sub>.
</li><li>
	 Calculate the specific rate constant, k<sub>q</sub>, for the quenching process. (Given: fluorescence lifetime of anthracene, τ<sub>0</sub> = 4.9 × 10‑9 sec)
</li><li>
	Calculate the diffusion controlled rate constant, k<sub>d</sub>, for the bimolecular process in ethanol by using the relation, k<sub>d</sub> = 8RT/3000η, where R is the gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and η is the viscosity of ethanol = 1.078 cP at 25 <sub>o</sub>C.
</li><li>
	Determine the value of the ratio, k<sub>q</sub>/k<sub>d</sub>, and discuss its significance.
